I want to use client side sorting of profiles after loading them in within a certain distance. 
I feel like I've never actually seen that before for personality type at least.
Facebook has sort by children and so on, but no tags or personality types. 
Not having this would just be lazy after all the data has been loaded into your phone anyway. 

You should be able to sort by: 

distance
height
age

children 
personality type
looking for 
tags
lists

Tags:
drug status, work out frequency, sleep schedule, student status,

Lists:
liked, disliked, favs

NO
edu, smoking, drinking, religion 

for the grid view im officially copying iphone. Shouldnt take that much longer and it is the best
- require more screen per pinch input
- fading pictures
- animate to adjacent zoom level unless second zoom level threshold is reached 


===========
== TODO: ==
===========
- // This is good but now I need to load in all firestore image paths, get the download 
  urls, and cache them to sqlite
  // Then when I open the profiles I can download the images to the doc dir

- check for radii cacheing after depleting a small seed radius

- check list of cached profiles against list of firebase profiles. Ensure no duplicates 

- arange firebase profiles in order and then check against cache again

- double click on banner to open in swipe view, swipe, and then it picks up at the begining of the cache instead of the     
  location of the profile. Returning to banner view doe not load in current swipe view location

- Check for unecessary page rebuilds with Widget build() print statements
  e.g. print('Swipe page building now!');

- Already checking initial pagination firebase queries. Check cache pagination 

- Fix location permissions so that when per denied after two denials a button appears to take user to location settings. Also fix
  redundant location requests. Be sure nothing works unless permissions are granted. 

===========
== BUGS: ==
===========
- too many builds when zooming out profiles too early 
- profile verification needs a look
- whole app needs a look

- shutting off the app mid query may break it
- the ring algo starts after initial load, and the next page buttonshould be loading until the initial ring query is complete. 

- after canceling the phone verif once, it no longer sends

- if initial query finds more than max profiles (210) in a hash of precision 6, it breaks

- if large initial hash exceeds firestore query limit, no query is made 

- After cacheing a large radius, the shortenRings function will know not to query any smaller radii, but this requires a moderate 
  ammount of calculations. It maybe easier to do this another way, but it only adds like .5 seconds of load time. 

- Make sure the ring algo picks up at the appropriate spot after the initial large hash query 

- The 5 mile radius is never cached after the initial ring algo. This loads in the first page after every filter 
  update 

- If rebuilt after the initial hash query and before the initial ring algo, the saveLastFirebaseProfile never runs and the ring algo ring shortener breaks. To fix consider fetching last profile from cache or just deleting cache and recaching profiles.

==========================

- there doesn't need to be a new list of saved, liked, and disliked profiles. Instead, toggle a saved, liked, or disliked tag in the existing users table to use for filtering and UI indicators. Currently a whole new list is created which uses more space and requires more indexing.
