I want to use client side sorting of profiles after loading them in within a certain distance. 
I feel like I've never actually seen that before for personality type at least.
Facebook has sort by children and so on, but no tags or personality types. 
Not having this would just be lazy after all the data has been loaded into your phone anyway. 

You should be able to sort by: 

distance
height
age

children 
personality type
looking for 
tags
lists

Tags:
drug status, work out frequency, sleep schedule, student status,

Lists:
liked, disliked, favs

NO
edu, smoking, drinking, religion
