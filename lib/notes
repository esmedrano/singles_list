I want to use client side sorting of profiles after loading them in within a certain distance. 
I feel like I've never actually seen that before for personality type at least.
Facebook has sort by children and so on, but no tags or personality types. 
Not having this would just be lazy after all the data has been loaded into your phone anyway. 

You should be able to sort by: 

distance
height
age

children 
personality type
looking for 
tags
lists

Tags:
drug status, work out frequency, sleep schedule, student status,

Lists:
liked, disliked, favs

NO
edu, smoking, drinking, religion 

for the grid view im officially copying iphone. Shouldnt take that much longer and it is the best
- require more screen per pinch input
- fading pictures
- animate to adjacent zoom level unless second zoom level threshold is reached 


===========
== TODO: ==
===========
- // This is good but now I need to load in all firestore image paths, get the download 
  urls, and cache them to sqlite
  // Then when I open the profiles I can download the images to the doc dir

===========
== BUGS: ==
===========
- too many builds when zooming out profiles too early 
- profile verification needs a look
- whole app needs a look
